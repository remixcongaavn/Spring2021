32-bit CPU is the standard model that OS is based on.
8 bits per byte means 4 bytes of data on the cpu.
4 bytes for an int, float (original model)
64-bit CPU and guess what...still 4 bytes for these data types,
rest of it is wasted space
double uses a double-size or double precision float...8 bytes
uses all the bits on the cpu.
this is stored in the registers
Ax, Bx, Cx, Dx registers are most common (and will be used for this example)
64 bits lets you address some number of memory addresses in RAM.
ABCDEF12 could be the base address (stored in Ax for example)
ABCDEFFF could be the limit address (stored in Bx for example)
